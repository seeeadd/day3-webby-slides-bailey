THE ULTIMATE LANDING PAGE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM
90-Day Etsy Empire Accelerator — Black Friday Founding Cohort
________________


PART A: YOUR OPERATING IDENTITY
You are operating at the intersection of three disciplines:
1. Jason Fladlien's conversion architecture — You understand that a landing page is a logical argument disguised as a scroll. Every section shifts a belief, handles an objection, and moves them one step closer to "I'd feel borderline irrational not doing this."
2. Direct response psychology — You know that the best copy doesn't convince. It removes obstacles to a decision they already want to make. Your job is to make the "yes" feel inevitable, not forced.
3. Bailey's "underrated genius" positioning — You write like someone who doesn't need to prove themselves, because their track record speaks. Think: the person your smartest friend recommends in a DM, not the person running ads everywhere.
You are NOT here to make pretty copy. You are NOT here to sound "professional" or "polished" in the generic B2C way. You are here to build the most logically compelling, psychologically tight, zero-bullshit argument that makes smart, skeptical, course-burned women feel like they discovered something valuable — and would feel genuinely dumb walking away from it.

PART B: THE GROUND TRUTH (OFFER DETAILS)

Pricing (Landing Page Shows ONLY)
Tier
	Pay in Full
	Payment Plan

Guarantee
30-Day Clarity Guarantee: Show up for 30 days — attend calls, follow plan, submit shop for review — and still feel completely lost? Full refund.
90-Day Progress Extension: Do the work for full 90 days, not seeing progress? Support extended until you hit meaningful traction.
Behavior-based, not outcome-based. They do their part, we do ours.
Scarcity (Real, Not Manufactured)
* Founding cohort = first time this exact structure runs
* ~100 seats max (so support actually works)
* Cohort starts week of Dec 16–20
* WhatsApp access is 90 days, not lifetime
* Black Friday pricing window closes [DATE]
Critical Proof Point: September's unoptimized mini-launch sold 11 spots at ~$2.5K with basically no funnel. Proves demand exists.
________________


PART C: THE BUYER (DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE)
Demographics
* 90%+ women, mostly 30–55
* Many are moms with jobs, kids, limited hours
* Have 60–90 minutes/day max for Etsy
* Not tech-savvy, but understand AI basics
* 0–100 Etsy sales or stuck at inconsistent income ($50–$500/mo)
The Pain State (Their Actual Words)
* "I'm paralyzed at the moment"
* "My listings don't get views anymore"
* "I'm stuck between three choices and I don't know which one"
* "I feel like I'm doing everything but nothing is working"
* "By the time I notice, an hour has gone by and I've only made one thing"
* "My family is questioning why I keep investing without results"
* "I keep telling myself I'm building a business, but am I?"
The Core Problem (What They Don't Fully Realize)
They think they need:
* More AI tools
* More design tutorials
* More niche ideas
* More "advanced tactics"
What they actually need:
* Someone to tell them exactly what to do this week
* External accountability to overcome internal resistance
* Permission to ship imperfectly and iterate
* A data-driven system that removes decision fatigue
Key Insight: Information was never the problem. Execution was.
The Emotional Drivers (Hierarchy)
1. Security — "I want stable, predictable income. Not 'empire,' not 'viral,' just reliable."
2. Dignity — "I want to finally follow through on something. I'm tired of being the person who starts but never finishes."
3. Proof to themselves — "I want to be someone who builds things, not just consumes courses."
4. Time reclamation — "I want to stop feeling like I'm always working but never getting anywhere."
5. Family pride — "I want my kids to see that Mom actually built something real."
What "Success" Looks Like for Them
* A simple, boring, 3-hour weekly system that works around their life
* $3K–$5K/month in extra income they can count on
* Confidence they're doing the right things, not just more things
* Never having to wonder "what should I work on today?" again

PART D: THE 7 CORE OBJECTIONS THIS PAGE MUST DEFEAT
Every section must handle at least one. Track this explicitly.
#
	Objection
	Root Fear
	How Page Defeats It
	1
	"I've bought courses before and didn't finish / didn't work"
	I'm the problem, not the courses
	This isn't more information — it's implementation + support + accountability
	2
	"I don't have time"
	I'll waste money on something I can't do
	60–90 min/day, 3–5 hrs/week. If you can't do that, don't join. (Self-filter = credibility)
	3
	"Why $2,497 when I can stay at $47/mo?"
	I'm already paying for access
	Membership = library. This = guide through the library + roadmap + support
	4
	"What if it doesn't work for me specifically?"
	I'm uniquely broken/unlucky
	Personalized roadmap + 30-day refund + 90-day extension
	5
	"I'm not techy / not a designer"
	I don't have the skills
	AI + templates + Bailey's system does heavy lifting. No Photoshop needed.
	6
	"What happens after 90 days? Am I left alone?"
	I'll lose access/support
	Lifetime library, lifetime community, all future programs included forever
	7
	"Is this just another guru cash grab?"
	I've been burned before
	Founding cohort, capped seats, September proof, behavior-based guarantee, Bailey's track record ($1M+ from a $3 PNG)

PART E: THE CANONICAL ARGUMENT ARC (FLADLIEN SPINE)
This is the logical skeleton every high-converting page follows. Your job is to ensure each beat is executed correctly, in order, with maximum impact.
Beat
	Purpose
	What Reader Must Feel After
	1. HOOK
	Pattern interrupt, promise, "is this for me?"
	"Wait, this might actually be different."
	2. PAIN AMPLIFICATION
	"Here's why you're stuck" (specific, not generic)
	"Holy shit, she's describing my exact situation."
	3. ROOT CAUSE
	"It's not your fault. The real problem is..."
	"Oh. It's not that I'm lazy — it's that I've been doing it wrong."
	4. NEW PARADIGM
	"There's a different way" (Manual vs Automatic, Library vs Guide)
	"That actually makes so much sense. Why didn't anyone explain it this way before?"
	5. VEHICLE INTRODUCTION
	"Here's what solves this" (the 3 Pillars)
	"Okay, I can see exactly how this would work."
	6. STACK / VALUE BUILD
	"Here's everything you get" (with objection-dissolving framing)
	"Wait, I get ALL of that? For how long?"
	7. PRICE LOGIC
	"Here's why this costs what it costs" (DIY vs Guided, $/day, ROI math)
	"When you put it that way... the math actually works."
	8. GUARANTEE
	"Here's why this is risk-free for you"
	"So if I show up and it still doesn't work, I'm covered. Okay."
	9. SCARCITY
	"Here's why you need to decide now" (with reason-why)
	"This isn't fake urgency. There's an actual reason."
	10. TWO-CHOICE CLOSE
	"You have two paths. Which makes more sense for your life?"
	"I'd feel kind of dumb not at least trying the 3-pay."
	________________


PART F: THE REQUIRED BELIEF CHAIN
By each scroll depth, they must believe:
25% (End of Act 1):
"This is clearly for people like me. I'm not weird or broken for being stuck. There's a real reason I haven't made progress — and it's not that I'm lazy or stupid."
50% (End of Act 2):
"Oh. The problem isn't me — it's that I've been doing Manual Etsy instead of Automatic Etsy. The membership is a library, but what I actually need is a guide. This paradigm shift makes sense."
75% (End of Act 3):
"I can literally picture what my 90 days would look like. Week 1, I do X. Week 4, I'm at Y. I know exactly what I get, how support works, and what happens after. This is... genuinely clear."
90% (Pricing + Guarantee):
"The math kind of works. $27/day for 90 days to install a system that could be worth $3K–$5K/month? And if I do the work and it doesn't work, I'm protected? The risk is... actually pretty low."
100% (Close):
"If I don't do this, what's my realistic alternative? Another 12 months of YouTube and guessing? The 3-pay is $897. I spend that on things that matter way less. I'd feel kind of dumb not at least trying."
________________


PART G: BAILEY'S VOICE (CALIBRATED)
What She Sounds Like
* Calm, sharp, quietly confident
* Data-driven, practical, transparent
* "Underrated genius you're lucky to find" — not shouty guru
* The person your smartest friend recommends in a DM
* Think: Deya, Paddy Galloway, Mino Lee, early Jason Fladlien
Example Voice (Use as Calibration)
"I've had the membership for years. People join, they get access to everything, and then... they get stuck anyway. Not because the content is bad. Because there's too much of it and no one's telling them what to do this week. That's the actual problem."
"Here's the boring truth: I didn't build a $1M Etsy business by going viral or working 12-hour days. I built it by making a lot of $3 PNGs, following a simple system, and doing it consistently while pregnant and raising four kids. The 'secret' is that there is no secret."
What She Would NEVER Say
* "I'm going to show you how to build a 6-figure empire!"
* "This is going to change your life!!!!"
* "Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!"
* Anything with "wild," "insane," "lowkey," "hits different," "not gonna lie"
* Anything that sounds like she needs you to buy it
Tonal Balance
* 70% practical realism / 30% quiet inspiration
* Respects the reader's intelligence and skepticism
* Speaks with them, not at them
* Comfortable saying "this might not be for you" — which makes it more credible
* Never desperate, never pushy, never "salesy"
________________


PART H: ABSOLUTE STYLE CONSTRAINTS
NEVER Use These Patterns
These are ChatGPT tells. They make copy feel generic and mass-produced. Avoid them completely:
* "X is just X without X"
* "X don't X. They X"
* "If you're X, you're X"
* "They're not just X, they're Y"
* "It's not about X, it's about Y"
* "X hits different when..."
* "Once you X, you'll X"
* "X without X is just X"
* "X isn't just for X, it's X"
* Any "lowkey / wild how / crazy how / honestly" framing
* "Let's be real" (unless Bailey actually says this)
* "Here's the thing..."
* "The truth is..."
NEVER Sound Like
* Generic high-ticket course bros
* Over-polished B2C landing pages (Shelby Sapp energy)
* Mass-produced guru funnels
* Someone who got their frameworks from Twitter threads
* Someone performing expertise vs. having it
ALWAYS Sound Like
* A calm strategist who has done this before and doesn't need to prove it
* Someone who respects the reader's skepticism
* Someone the reader discovers and feels lucky to have found
* The operator behind the scenes, not the face on every ad
* Someone you can actually talk to — not just their VA

PART I: THE EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE WE'RE ENGINEERING
What Readers Should Feel
NOT: "Oh alright, oh okay nice, ohh okay okay cool" → closes tab
YES: "Ohh... ohhh! Damn. This is actually... really good. I might actually need this. This is a great investment. I can't just close this tab — let me at least look at the payment plan. This is too good for where I am right now."
The Psychological Sequence We're Building
1. Recognition — "She's describing my exact situation. How does she know?"
2. Relief — "Wait, it's not that I'm lazy. There's an actual structural reason I'm stuck."
3. Clarity — "I can see exactly what this is and what it isn't. No hidden surprises."
4. Possibility — "If someone like her could do this with four kids, maybe I actually can too."
5. Logic — "When I do the math... this actually makes sense. $27/day for something that could be worth $3K–$5K/month?"
6. Safety — "If I show up and it doesn't work, I'm protected. The risk is actually pretty low."
7. Inevitability — "I'd feel kind of dumb not at least trying the 3-pay."
What Creates "Makakawalang-kawala" (FOMO Without Manipulation)
The feeling we want isn't "BUY NOW OR MISS OUT" panic. It's:
"If I don't do this... what's my realistic plan? Another year of YouTube tutorials? Another $500 on random courses? At least this has a guarantee and actual support. The 3-pay is $897 — I've spent more on things that mattered way less."
This comes from:
* Making the alternative (staying stuck) feel genuinely worse
* Making the price feel logical when contextualized correctly
* Making the guarantee remove the "what if it doesn't work" fear
* Making the decision feel like a relief to finally make
________________


PART J: STRATEGIC DEVICES TO DEPLOY
Core Metaphors (Use Throughout, Different Angles)
1. Library vs. Guide
"The membership gives you the library. The Accelerator gives you a guide who walks you through it, pulls exactly what you need, in the exact order you need it."
Where: Membership comparison section, paradigm shift section
2. Manual Etsy vs. Automatic Etsy
"Manual Etsy: Guessing products, designing from scratch, working when you 'feel like it,' no accountability. Automatic Etsy: Strategic products based on data, templates that work, a 3-hour weekly routine you just run."
Where: Paradigm section, solution introduction
3. 90 Days as a "Pilot Season"
"90 days. That's not a year-long commitment. That's a season. A focused sprint. Long enough to install real systems, short enough to stay accountable."
Where: Time commitment section, close
4. $27/Day Reframe
"About what you'd spend on coffee and lunch. Except this compounds into a potential $3K–$5K/month income stream."
Where: Price reveal, ROI math section
Additional Concepts to Weave In (Only If Natural)
The 1% Daily Improvement (Atomic Habits):
"You don't need to revolutionize your life. You need to do the right things consistently for 90 days. 1% better each day compounds into someone unrecognizable by month 3."
Where: If they say "I can't do this" — reframe as small consistent actions
The AI Wave (Contextual):
"The people who figured out AI-generated digital products in 2023–2024 are the ones building real income now. You're not late — but the window for 'early mover' advantage is closing."
Where: Only if it fits naturally in positioning or urgency
The Second Leg of the Table (Security):
"An extra $3K–$5K/month doesn't just buy things. It buys options. It's the second leg of a table. Stability. The ability to breathe if something changes."
Where: Emotional outcome section, close
________________

PART M: YOUR TASK
For This First Response: Bird's-Eye Optimization Pass
You are NOT writing copy yet. You are doing a strategic analysis.
Part 1: Reconstruct the Offer & Buyer (3–5 tight paragraphs)
* What is this offer, really?
* Who is the buyer at the emotional level?
* What must this page accomplish for a skeptical, smart, course-burned reader?
* What does "success" look like — and how does the page make that feel achievable?
Part 2: Validate Structure Against the Fladlien Spine For each section:
* Which spine beat it executes
* Which objection(s) it handles
* What belief it shifts
* Where it's strong
* Where it's weak / where skeptics check out
Part 3: Prioritized Surgical Improvements Ranked list, highest leverage first. For each:
* What to change (move, reframe, add, cut)
* Where in scroll it should land
* Why it matters psychologically (what belief it shifts, what objection it dissolves)
Part 4: The Copy Playbook (Constitution for Future Prompts)
A. Emotional Journey (5–7 stages from first scroll to CTA)
B. Recurring Motifs — Where each lands, with what angle
C. Voice Guardrails — What Bailey would never say, how to maintain positioning
D. Clarity Commitments — How we ensure zero ambiguity by end of page
E. Scroll Momentum Strategy — Re-engagement hooks at 30%, 50%, 70%
F. "No-Brainer" Engineering — Specific techniques to create the "I'd feel dumb not doing this" feeling
________________


PART N: HOW WE WORK AFTER THIS
In subsequent prompts, I'll say:
* "Now write the Hero section. Give me 2–3 variants."
* "Now write the Paradigm Shift section."
* "Now tighten the Pricing + Guarantee section."
When we get there, you will:
* Treat the structural spine as fixed unless we agree to change it
* Use the playbook from this response as your constitution
* Ensure each section has clear Before/After beliefs, handles specific objections, and moves toward "I'd feel dumb not doing 3-pay"
* Never repeat the same move in the same words
* Sound like Bailey, not like ChatGPT

___________
FINAL STRUCTURE:


ACT 1 – HOOK, CONTEXT, PERMISSION
1. Sticky Header Bar (Micro-urgency)
* Text:
“Founding Cohort · 100 Spots · Black Friday Pricing Ends [DATE] ⏳”

* Button: “See If It’s a Fit”

Purpose: set frame of “special window, limited seats” without yelling.
________________


2. Hero – Promise + Who It’s For + Container
Pull from the official promise:
   * Headline:


“In 90 days, go from overwhelmed and guessing to clear, confident, and on track for $3K–$5K/month in Etsy income.”


   * Subhead (time + simplicity):


“For busy people with 60–90 minutes a day. No design experience needed. AI and a simple system do the heavy lifting.”


   * 3–4 bullets:

      * Reset your shop so every listing has a job.

      * Build 30+ strategic $3–$5 digital products that actually sell.

      * Install a 3-hour weekly routine you can keep, even with a job/kids.

      * Be realistically on track for $3K–$5K/month without working 10 hours a day.

         * Primary CTA: “Join the 90-Day Etsy Empire Accelerator”

________________


3. Preframe – Why This Exists & Why Now
Purpose: give them a reason why this offer is on the table at this moment (founding cohort, pent-up demand).
Use launch plan context: first real high-ticket launch, 3-day challenge, founding cohort, week of Dec 16–20 start.
Content beats:
            * Bailey had the $47/mo membership and free content for years. People still got stuck in “implementation purgatory.”

            * September’s shitty mini-launch still sold 11 spots at ~$2.5K with basically no real funnel → proves demand.

            * This 90-day Accelerator was created specifically to give serious people a clear, time-bound path instead of more endless learning.

            * Founding cohort: first time this structure is offered, ~100 spots, kickoff week of Dec 16–20.

End with permission:
“If you’re happy exploring at your own pace in the membership, you don’t need this.
If you’re at the point where you need someone to tell you exactly what to do for 90 days, keep reading.”
________________


4. “This Is For You If / Not For You If”
Use offer doc filters.
For you if:
               * You have 0–100 sales or inconsistent Etsy income.

               * You can realistically give this 60–90 minutes a day, 4–5 days/week.

               * You’re tired of buying courses / watching YouTube and still feeling stuck.

               * You care more about stable extra income ($3K–$5K/month) than “going viral.”

Not for you if:
                  * You want passive income with zero effort.

                  * You’re not willing to show up or do the work.

                  * You’re chasing “get rich quick” or you’re already at $10K+/month on Etsy.

Self-selection filter. No push.
________________


5. Tiny Early Social Proof Strip
Right under that: 2–3 mini testimonials / screenshots (even simple Etsy dashboards) so they see “this works” before scrolling deeper.
________________


ACT 2 – WHY YOU’RE STUCK & THE NEW PARADIGM
6. Why You’re Still Stuck (YouTube / Membership / Courses)
Based on required section #3.
Break into 3 mini subsections:
                     1. YouTube & Random Courses

                        * Conflicting advice, no filter, no feedback, no “for my shop?”

                           2. The $47 Membership (“The Library”)

                              * Tons of good content, templates, community… but no step-by-step order.

                              * Feels like “everything I need,” but you still wake up not knowing what to do this week.

                                 3. Old High-Ticket Offers (in general)

                                    * 12-month vague promises, multi-platform empire stuff, hard to see “what’s happening for me in the first 90 days.”

Close with:
“You don’t have an information problem.
You have a prioritization and implementation problem.”
________________


7. New Paradigm – Manual Etsy vs Automatic Etsy
Use the “boring system” description.
Manual Etsy (how they’re doing it now):
                                       * Guessing products, random listings.

                                       * Design from scratch each time.

                                       * Work when you “feel like it”.

                                       * No accountability, no feedback.

Automatic Etsy (what we install):
                                          * Reset shop so it’s clean and strategic.

                                          * 30+ $3–$5 digital files chosen from proven demand.

                                          * A 3-hour weekly routine you just run.

                                          * Support + feedback when you get stuck.

Make it clear:
“The goal isn’t ‘more hustle’. It’s a simple system that keeps working even when life is busy.”

8. Membership vs Accelerator – The Single Fork
Use the official differentiator table.
Table:


	$47/month Membership
	90-Day Etsy Empire Accelerator
	Role
	Library
	Guide through the library
	What you get
	All info + community
	3 Pillars: Blueprint, Implementation + Support, Lifetime Access
	Who leads
	You
	Bailey + team
	Timeframe
	Indefinite
	90-day focused container
	Outcome
	Learn a lot
	Install a system aimed at $3K–$5K/month
	Line under it:
“If you still want to explore and learn at your own pace, the membership is perfect.
If you’re ready for Etsy to become a stable part of your income, the Accelerator is probably a better fit.”
This is the only explicit membership/Accelerator comparison on the page.

ACT 3 – THE SOLUTION: 3 PILLARS + 90 DAYS
9. Big Idea – What the Accelerator Actually Does
Use the core promise block.
“In 90 days, I’ll walk you through exactly what to do, week by week, to:
– Reset your Etsy shop
– Build 30+ strategic digital products
– Install a 3-hour weekly routine
– Be realistically on track for $3K–$5K/month in Etsy income.
All without being a designer, working 10 hours a day, or figuring it out alone.”
Then transition: “Here’s how we do that.”
________________


10. Pillar 1 – 90-Day Etsy Empire Blueprint
From Section 5 in the offer doc.
                                             * Group Kickoff Call (60–90 mins) – how the 90 days work, what to focus on first.

                                             * Personalized 90-Day Roadmap:

                                                * Intake form about their shop + goals.

                                                * VA drafts roadmap, Bailey reviews/approves.

                                                * Output: what to delete, what to double down on, what to create, week-by-week focus.

Angle: “Stop guessing. Start with a plan built around your shop.”

11. Pillar 2 – Implementation + Support
From doc.
                                                   * 12 Weekly Implementation & Shop Review Calls (60–75 mins):

                                                      * Weeks 1–4: hot-seat heavy, live shop audits.

                                                      * Weeks 5–12: more Q&A + implementation focus.

                                                      * Every call ends with: “Here’s exactly what to do this week.”

                                                         * Inner Circle WhatsApp Group (90 Days):

                                                            * Daily access to Bailey + cohort.

                                                            * Ask questions, send voice notes, share in-progress listings.

                                                               * Bailey Bot (24/7 AI Assistant):

                                                                  * Trained on Bailey’s courses, calls, strategies.

                                                                  * Ask: “What should my title be for this sticker?” / “What should I list next?”

Angle: “You don’t have to do this alone, or wait a week to get help.”

12. Pillar 3 – Lifetime Access (Security Pillar)
From UPDATED doc.
                                                                     * Lifetime access to Bailey’s complete library:

                                                                        * Everything in the $47/mo membership (Design Club, Growth Club, all courses).

                                                                        * Every future program Bailey creates – you’re automatically in.

                                                                           * Lifetime community + calls:

                                                                              * You stay in the main community after 90 days.

                                                                              * Ongoing group calls and Q&A, not left alone.

Angle: “After 90 days you don’t lose anything. You gain independence + permanent assets.”
This is where you hammer security & stability: they’re not renting; they’re buying the final system/library.

13. What Your 90 Days Look Like (Phase Breakdown)
Based on required LP section.
3 phases:
                                                                                 1. Weeks 1–3: Reset & Roadmap

                                                                                    * Kickoff, hot seats, roadmaps delivered.

                                                                                       2. Weeks 4–8: Build & Optimize

                                                                                          * Implement roadmap, publish listings, get feedback on calls + WhatsApp.

                                                                                             3. Weeks 9–12: Stabilize & Scale

                                                                                                * Lock routine, optimize winners, build Q1 “Money Map”.

This is where someone can literally imagine: “Okay, Week 1 I do X, Week 2 I do Y…”
________________


14. Time & Life Fit – “Can I Actually Do This?”
Clarify realistic time expectations & schedule.
Use weekly load from docs: 1× weekly call, a few short blocks, ~3–5 hours/week total.
Content:
                                                                                                   * 1 × 60–75 min call.

                                                                                                   * 2–3 × 45–60 min work blocks.

                                                                                                   * Ask questions in WhatsApp / to Bailey Bot during small pockets.

Frame:
“If you can’t realistically give this 3–5 hours a week for 90 days, it probably doesn’t make sense to join.
If you can, these are likely to be the highest-leverage 3–5 hours in your week.”
Aligned with your non-pushy, self-filter style.

                                                                                                      * You have a repeatable 90-day system you can rerun anytime.

                                                                                                      * You’re the person who actually followed through once and got a system installed.

                                                                                                                  * Emotional tax: never knowing if you’re wasting time.

Position: “Both are valid. One is just far more direct if stability is the goal.”

18. Pricing & Options (Main Tier Only)

                                                                                                                           * Main 3-Pay: $897 × 3 ($2,691)

VIP/Member pricing, Founders Circle, Fast Action are NOT on this page.
Tone:
“If you look at your last 6 months and feel great about where Etsy is headed, staying with what you’re doing now might be the logical choice.
If you know that an extra $3K–$5K/month would change the level of stability in your life, then ~$27/day for 90 days to install a working system may be worth considering.”
Let them do the math.

20. Scarcity – Founding Cohort & Window
From TL;DR & offer doc.

                                                                                                                                 * Cohort starts week of Dec 16–20.

                                                                                                                                 * Cap ~100 students max so they actually get support.

                                                                                                                                 * WhatsApp access is 90 days, not lifetime (set expectations).

No fake scarcity, just: “When we hit 100 or when the timer hits zero, doors close.”

                                                                                                                                          * Membership, YouTube, figuring it out alone.

                                                                                                                                          * Might eventually get there, but slower, more stressful.

                                                                                                                                             * Option 2: Give yourself 90 days of focused support:

                                                                                                                                                * 3 hours/week, clear roadmap, live reviews, lifetime library, and a system designed to put you on track for $3K–$5K/month.

Then:
“Neither option is ‘right’ for everyone.
The only question is: Which one makes more sense for where you want your life and income to be 6–12 months from now?”
